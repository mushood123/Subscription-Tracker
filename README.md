Below is a well-structured README file for your GitHub project "Subscription-Tracker". I've designed it based on common best practices for README files (inspired by examples from the web, such as FreeCodeCamp's guide and various GitHub repositories) while incorporating the specific details you provided. This README includes sections for project overview, features, technologies, setup instructions, and more to ensure clarity and usability.

# Subscription-Tracker

A backend-focused REST API application built with Node.js and Express.js to help users manage and track their subscriptions. The system authorizes users, allows them to add subscriptions, tracks renewal dates, and sends reminder emails using Nodemailer. It leverages MongoDB for data storage, JWT for secure authorization, Arcjet for security, Upstash Workflows for email reminders, and ESLint for code quality.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Subscription Management**: Add, update, and delete subscriptions with renewal dates.
- **Automated Reminders**: Sends email reminders to users before their subscriptions expire using Nodemailer and Upstash Workflows.
- **Security**: Protects against request bombing and bot attacks with Arcjet.
- **Code Quality**: Enforces consistent code style and linting with ESLint.
- **RESTful API**: Structured endpoints for seamless interaction with the backend.

## Technologies
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for creating RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user and subscription data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for user authentication and authorization.
- **Arcjet**: Security layer to prevent request flooding and bot detection.
- **Upstash Workflows**: Serverless workflow engine to schedule and send email reminders.
- **Nodemailer**: Email-sending library for subscription renewal notifications.
- **ESLint**: Linting tool to maintain code quality and consistency.

### How These Technologies Work Together
- **MongoDB** stores user profiles and subscription details (e.g., name, renewal date, cost).
- **JWT** ensures only authorized users can access protected routes (e.g., adding subscriptions).
- **Arcjet** monitors incoming requests to block malicious traffic, keeping the API secure.
- **Upstash Workflows** schedules reminders by triggering Nodemailer to send emails at the right time.
- **Express.js** handles routing and API logic, while **Node.js** powers the runtime environment.
- **ESLint** ensures clean, readable, and maintainable code.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (local instance or MongoDB Atlas)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)
- Accounts for:
  - **Upstash** (for workflows)
  - **Arcjet** (for security)
  - An SMTP service (e.g., Gmail) for Nodemailer

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mushood123/Subscription-Tracker.git
   cd Subscription-Tracker
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables (see below).

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:
```
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>
ARCJET_KEY=<your-arcjet-api-key>
UPSTASH_TOKEN=<your-upstash-token>
NODEMAILER_EMAIL=<your-email-address>
NODEMAILER_PASS=<your-email-password-or-app-specific-password>
```

### Running the Application
1. Start the MongoDB server (if local).
2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

### Explanation of Design Choices
1. **Clarity**: The README starts with a concise project description and a table of contents for easy navigation, a common practice in well-designed READMEs (e.g., FreeCodeCamp’s guide).
2. **Technologies Section**: I added a subsection explaining how the technologies integrate, which helps developers understand the project’s architecture.
3. **Setup Instructions**: Detailed steps with prerequisites, installation, and environment variables make it beginner-friendly, inspired by Node.js project READMEs on GitHub.
4. **API Endpoints**: A table format (seen in many REST API projects) provides a quick reference for developers.
5. **Professional Touches**: Contributing guidelines, license, and contact info align with GitHub best practices.

This README should effectively communicate your project’s purpose and setup process while showcasing its technical components! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
